    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, our aim is to create an autonomous agent using the LangChain framework. We will explore the concept of \"Plan and Execute\" LangChain agents and their ability to generate insightful analysis reports based on retrieved documents from Deep Lake.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by understanding the fundamentals of the \"Plan and Execute\" LangChain agent framework and its benefits for complex long-term planning. Then, we will delve into our project's implementation details and workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the lesson, you will have a solid understanding of building autonomous agents using the LangChain framework and be equipped with the skills to create analysis reports using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Workflow\n",
    "This is the workflow we’ll follow in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Saving Documents on Deep Lake:\n",
    "We will begin by learning how to save documents on Deep Lake, which serves as our knowledge repository. Deep Lake provides information that our agents can leverage for analysis and report generation.\n",
    "2. Creating a Document Retrieval Tool:\n",
    "Next, we will develop a tool that enables our agent to retrieve the most relevant documents from Deep Lake based on a given query.\n",
    "3. Using the Plan and Execute Agent:\n",
    "The core of our project involves employing a \"Plan and Execute\" agent to devise a plan for answering a specific query about creating an overview of a topic. Our specific objective is to generate a comprehensive outline of recent events related to Artificial Intelligence regulations by governments, but the final agent could also work for other similar objectives as well.<br>\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will feed the query into the planner component of the agent, which will utilize a language model's reasoning ability to plan out the steps required. The planner will consider various factors, including the complexity of the query and instructions for the tool used to generate a step-by-step plan or lower-level queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan will then be passed to the executor component, which will determine the appropriate tools or actions required to execute each step of the plan. The executor, initially implemented as an Action Agent, will make use of the tools we developed earlier, such as the document retrieval tool, to gather relevant information and execute the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing the \"Plan and Execute\" agent framework, we can achieve more accurate and reliable analysis reports while handling complex long-term planning scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's dive in and explore the potential for generating insightful analysis reports!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan and Execute\n",
    "Plan and Execute agents are a new type of agent executor offering a different approach than the traditional agents supported in LangChain. These agents are heavily inspired by the BabyAGI framework and the recent Plan-and-Solve paper. The primary goal of \"Plan and Execute\" agents is to enable more complex long-term planning, even at the cost of making more calls to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The planner in the \"Plan-and-Execute\" framework typically utilizes a language model's reasoning ability to plan out steps and handle ambiguity and edge cases.\n",
    "2. The executor, initially an Action Agent, takes the planner's high-level objectives (steps) and determines the tools or actions required to accomplish each step.\n",
    "This separation of planning and execution allows for improved reliability and flexibility. It also facilitates the possibility of replacing these components with smaller, fine-tuned models in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the implementation of the \"Plan and Execute\" agent and how to integrate it with Deep Lake for document retrieval and see the agent in action as it generates an analysis report based on the given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Let’s set up the OpenAI API and Activeloop keys in environment variables."

He can often be sighted at tech conferences with a strong coffee in one hand and a laptop in the other. If it's geeky, he’s probably into it. Find him on Twitter (@Gadget_Ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\\n\\nAdvancements in machine learning and speech recognition technology have made information more accessible to people, particularly those who rely on voice to access information. However, the lack of labelled data for numerous languages poses a significant challenge in developing high-quality machine-learning models.\\n\\nIn response to this problem, the Meta-led Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) project has made remarkable strides in expanding language coverage and improving the performance of speech recognition and synthesis models.\\n\\nBy combining self-supervised learning techniques with a diverse dataset of religious readings, the MMS project has achieved impressive results in growing the ~100 languages supported by existing speech recognition models to over 1,100 languages.\\n\\nBreaking down language barriers\\n\\nTo address the scarcity of labelled data for most languages, the MMS project utilised religious texts, such as the Bible, which have been translated into numerous languages.\\n\\nThese translations provided publicly available audio recordings of people reading the texts, enabling the creation of a dataset comprising readings of the New Testament in over 1,100 languages.\\n\\nBy including unlabeled recordings of other religious readings, the project expanded language coverage to recognise over 4,000 languages.\\n\\nDespite the dataset’s specific domain and predominantly male speakers, the models performed equally well for male and female voices. Meta also says it did not introduce any religious bias.\\n\\nOvercoming challenges through self-supervised learning\\n\\nTraining conventional supervised speech recognition models with just 32 hours of data per language is inadequate.\\n\\nTo overcome this limitation, the MMS project leveraged the benefits of the wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised speech representation learning technique.\\n\\nBy training self-supervised models on approximately 500,000 hours of speech data across 1,400 languages, the project significantly reduced the reliance on labelled data.\\n\\nThe resulting models were then fine-tuned for specific speech tasks, such as multilingual speech recognition and language identification.\\n\\nImpressive results\\n\\nEvaluation of the models trained on the MMS data revealed impressive results. In a comparison with OpenAI’s Whisper, the MMS models exhibited half the word error rate while covering 11 times more languages.\\n\\nFurthermore, the MMS project successfully built text-to-speech systems for over 1,100 languages. Despite the limitation of having relatively few different speakers for many languages, the speech generated by these systems exhibited high quality.\\n\\nWhile the MMS models have shown promising results, it is essential to acknowledge their imperfections. Mistranscriptions or misinterpretations by the speech-to-text model could result in offensive or inaccurate language. The MMS project emphasises collaboration across the AI community to mitigate such risks.\\n\\nYou can read the MMS paper here or find the project on GitHub.\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Find him on Twitter (@Gadget_Ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\\n\\nChina’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) has launched a campaign to combat fake news generated by AI.\\n\\nThe crackdown is focused on news providers, including short video platforms and popular search lists.\\n\\nThe CAC specifically highlighted manipulative practices such as the use of AI virtual anchors, forged studio scenes, fake news accounts mimicking legitimate ones, and the manipulation of news to create misleading storylines. These practices are employed to generate what’s often known as clickbait.\\n\\nAccording to the CAC, it has already taken action against 107,000 counterfeit news accounts and fake anchors, as well as removing 835,000 pieces of false information. The internet regulator is urging citizens to report any encounters with fake news accounts online.\\n\\nIn line with China’s AI media law, which aims to curb the spread of fake news generated by AI, the police recently detained an individual in the Gansu province for creating fake news using ChatGPT.\\n\\nThe person used ChatGPT to fabricate a news article about a train crash, which quickly gained traction on social media platforms. The police took action against the individual for spreading false information with the intention of increasing website traffic.\\n\\nChatGPT is not available directly in China, but users can access it using a supported foreign phone number and a virtual private network (VPN). However, access to foreign phone numbers and VPNs is restricted in China.\\n\\nThe AI-generated media law, effective since 10 January 2023, not only targets individuals like the one detained in Gansu but also holds “deep synthesis service providers” accountable for preventing the misuse of AI algorithms for illegal activities such as fraud, scams, and the dissemination of fake information.\\n\\nThe implementation of this law poses challenges for companies like Tencent, the developer of WeChat, as they need to ensure their AI algorithms are not misused.\\n\\nTencent recently introduced what is essentially a “Deepfakes-as-a-Service” product which enables users to create high-definition digital humans for a fee, raising concerns about the potential misuse of such technology.\\n\\nThe Chinese government’s efforts to combat fake news and regulate online communication highlight its commitment to maintaining a secure and trustworthy digital environment, although concerns about censorship and the restriction of freedom of expression have been raised by critics.\\n\\n(Photo by NII on Unsplash)\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?
