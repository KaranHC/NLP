    "### Introduction\n",
    "Prompting is considered the most effective method of interacting with language models as it enables querying information using natural language. We already went through the prompting techniques and briefly used chains earlier. In this lesson, the chains will explain the chains in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chains are responsible for creating an end-to-end pipeline for using the language models. They will join the model, prompt, memory, parsing output, and debugging capability and provide an easy-to-use interface. A chain will \n",
    "1. receive the user’s query as an input, \n",
    "2. process the LLM’s response, and lastly, \n",
    "3. return the output to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to design a custom pipeline by inheriting the Chain class. For example, the LLMChain is the simplest form of chain in LangChain, inheriting from the Chain parent class. We will start by going through ways to invoke this class and follow it by looking at adding different functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### LLMChain\n",
    "Several methods are available for utilizing a chain, each yielding a distinct output format. The example in this section is creating a bot that can suggest a replacement word based on context. The code snippet below demonstrates the utilization of the GPT-3 model through the OpenAI API. It generates a prompt using the PromptTemplate from LangChain, and finally, the LLMChain class ties all the components. Also, It is important to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your API credentials from OpenAI. Remember to install the required packages with the following command: pip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai tiktoken."
