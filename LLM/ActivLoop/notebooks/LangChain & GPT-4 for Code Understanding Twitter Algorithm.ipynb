    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson we will explore how LangChain, Deep Lake, and GPT-4 can transform our understanding of complex codebases, such as Twitter's open-sourced recommendation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables us to ask any question directly to the source code, significantly speeding up the code comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is essentially a wrapper that makes Large Language Models like GPT-4 more accessible and usable, providing a new way to build user interfaces. LangChain augments LLMs with memory and context, making it especially valuable for understanding codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Lake, in the LangChain ecosystem, is a serverless, open-source, and multi-modal vector store. It stores both the embeddings and the original data with automatic version control, making it a crucial component in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conversational Retriever Chain is a system that interacts with the data stored in Deep Lake. It retrieves the most relevant code snippets and details based on user queries, using context-sensitive filtering and ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll learn how to index a codebase, store embeddings and code in Deep Lake, set up a Conversational Retriever Chain, and ask insightful questions to the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Workflow\n",
    "This guide involves understanding source code using LangChain in four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install necessary libraries like langchain, deeplake, openai and tiktoken, and authenticate with Deep Lake and OpenAI.\n",
    "2. Optionally, index a codebase by cloning the repository, parsing the code, dividing it into chunks, and using OpenAI to perform indexing.\n",
    "3. Establish a Conversational Retriever Chain by loading the dataset, setting up the retriever, and connecting to a language model like GPT-4 for question answering.\n",
    "4. Query the codebase in natural language and retrieve answers. The guide ends with a demonstration of how to ask and retrieve answers to several questions about the indexed codebase.<br><br>\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll have a better understanding of how to use LangChain, Deep Lake, and GPT-4 to quickly comprehend any codebase. Plus, you'll gain insight into the inner workings of Twitter's recommendation algorithm."
