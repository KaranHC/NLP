    "### Introduction\n",
    "Vector embeddings are among the most intriguing and beneficial aspects of machine learning, playing a pivotal role in many natural language processing, recommendation, and search algorithms. If you've interacted with recommendation engines, voice assistants, or language translators, you've engaged with systems that utilize embeddings.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are dense vector representations of data that encapsulate semantic information, making them suitable for various machine-learning tasks such as clustering, recommendation, and classification. They transform human-perceived semantic similarity into closeness in vector space and can be generated for different data types, including text, images, and audio.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For text data, models like the GPT family of models and Llama are employed to create vector embeddings for words, sentences, or paragraphs. In the case of images, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG and Inception can generate embeddings. Audio recordings can be converted into vectors using image embedding techniques applied to visual representations of audio frequencies, like spectrograms. Deep neural networks are commonly employed to train models that convert objects into vectors. The resulting embeddings are typically high-dimensional and dense.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are extensively used in similarity search applications, such as KNN and ANN, which require calculating distances between vectors to determine similarity. Nearest neighbor search can be employed for tasks like de-duplication, recommendations, anomaly detection, and reverse image search.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity search and vector embeddings \n",
    "OpenAI offers a powerful language model called GPT-3, which can be used for various tasks, such as generating embeddings and performing similarity searches. In this example, we'll use the OpenAI API to generate embeddings for a set of documents and then perform a similarity search using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install the required packages with the following command: pip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai tiktoken scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create an API key from the OpenAI website and set it as an environment variable:"

In other instances, they are incorporated into various models to share insights across akin items rather than considering them as entirely distinct entities. This renders embeddings effective in representing aspects like web browsing patterns, textual data, and e-commerce transactions for subsequent model applications.\n",

    "Embedding models are a type of machine learning model that convert discrete data into continuous vectors. In the context of natural language processing, these discrete data points can be words, sentences, or even entire documents. The generated vectors, also known as embeddings, are designed to capture the semantic meaning of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, words that are semantically similar (e.g., 'cat' and 'kitten') would have similar embeddings. These embeddings are dense, which means that they use many dimensions (often hundreds) to capture nuances in meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit of embeddings is that they allow us to use mathematical operations to reason about semantic meaning. For example, we can calculate the cosine similarity between two embeddings to assess how semantically similar the corresponding words or documents are.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize our embedding model. For this task, we've chosen the pre-trained \"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\" model. This model is designed to transform sentences into embeddings - vectors that encapsulate the semantic meaning of the sentences. The model_kwargs parameter is used here to specify that we want our computations to be performed on the CPU."

    "This pipeline demonstrates how to leverage the power of the LangChain, OpenAI, and Deep Lake libraries and products to create a conversational AI model capable of retrieving and answering questions based on the content of a given repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down each step to understand how these technologies work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OpenAI and LangChain Integration: LangChain, a library built for chaining NLP models, is designed to work seamlessly with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for language understanding and generation. You've initialized OpenAI embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings(), and these embeddings are later used to transform the text into a high-dimensional vector representation. This vector representation captures the semantic essence of the text and is essential for information retrieval tasks.\n",
    "2. Deep Lake: Deep Lake is a Vector Store for creating, storing, and querying vector representations (also known as embeddings) of data.\n",
    "3. Text Retrieval: Using the db.as_retriever() function, you've transformed the Deep Lake dataset into a retriever object. This object is designed to fetch the most relevant pieces of text from the dataset based on the semantic similarity of their embeddings.\n",
    "4. Question Answering: The final step involves setting up a RetrievalQA chain from LangChain. This chain is designed to accept a natural language question, transform it into an embedding, retrieve the most relevant document chunks from the Deep Lake dataset, and generate a natural language answer. The ChatOpenAI model, which is the underlying model of this chain, is responsible for both the question embedding and the answer generation.\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    " In conclusion, vector embeddings are a cornerstone in capturing and understanding the rich contextual information in our textual data. This representation becomes increasingly important when dealing with language models like GPT-3.5-turbo, which have a limited token capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've used embeddings from OpenAI and incorporated embeddings from Hugging Face and Cohere. The former, a well-known AI research organization, provides Transformer-based models that are highly versatile and widely used. Cohere offers innovative multilingual language models that are a significant asset in a globally interconnected world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building upon these technologies, we've walked through the process of creating a conversational AI application, specifically a Q&A system leveraging Deep Lake. This application demonstrates the potential of these combined technologies - LangChain for chaining together complex NLP tasks, Hugging Face, Cohere, and OpenAI for generating high-quality embeddings, and Deep Lake for managing these embeddings in a vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson we’ll build a customer support question-answering chatbot leveraging our new knowledge about indexes and retrievers."
