    "### Introduction\n",
    "Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline that involves developing and optimizing prompts to use language models for various applications and research topics efficiently. It helps to understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs better and is essential for many NLP tasks. We will provide practical examples to demonstrate the difference between good and bad prompts, helping you to understand the nuances of prompt engineering better.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid foundation in the knowledge and strategies needed to create powerful prompts that enable LLMs to deliver accurate, contextually relevant, and insightful responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Role Prompting\n",
    "Role prompting involves asking the LLM to assume a specific role or identity before performing a given task, such as acting as a copywriter. This can help guide the model's response by providing a context or perspective for the task. To work with role prompts, you could iteratively:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify the role in your prompt, e.g., \"As a copywriter, create some attention-grabbing taglines for AWS services.\"\n",
    "Use the prompt to generate an output from an LLM.\n",
    "Analyze the generated response and, if necessary, refine the prompt for better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the LLM is asked to act as a futuristic robot band conductor and suggest a song title related to the given theme and year. (A reminder to set your OpenAI API key in your environment variables using the OPENAI_API_KEY key) Remember to install the required packages with the following command: pip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai tiktoken"

    "Clear instructions: The prompt is phrased as a clear request for help in generating a song title, and it specifies the context: \"As a futuristic robot band conductor.\" This helps the LLM understand that the desired output should be a song title related to a futuristic scenario.<br>\n",
    "Specificity: The prompt asks for a song title that relates to a specific theme and a specific year, \"{theme} in the year {year}.\" This provides enough context for the LLM to generate a relevant and creative output. The prompt can be adapted for different themes and years by using input variables, making it versatile and reusable.<br>\n",
    "Open-ended creativity: The prompt allows for open-ended creativity, as it doesn't limit the LLM to a particular format or style for the song title. The LLM can generate a diverse range of song titles based on the given theme and year.<br>\n",
    "Focus on the task: The prompt is focused solely on generating a song title, making it easier for the LLM to provide a suitable output without getting sidetracked by unrelated topics.<br><br>\n",

    "Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT) is a technique developed to encourage large language models to explain their reasoning process, leading to more accurate results. By providing few-shot exemplars demonstrating the reasoning process, the LLM is guided to explain its reasoning when answering the prompt. This approach has been found effective in improving results on tasks like arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning.\n",

First, it can help break down complex tasks by assisting the LLM in decomposing a complex task into simpler steps, making it easier to understand and solve the problem. This is particularly useful for calculations, logic, or multi-step reasoning tasks. Second, CoT can guide the model through related prompts, helping generate more coherent and contextually relevant outputs. This can lead to more accurate and useful responses in tasks that require a deep understanding of the problem or domain.\n",

    "There are some limitations to consider when using CoT. One limitation is that it has been found to yield performance gains only when used with models of approximately 100 billion parameters or larger; smaller models tend to produce illogical chains of thought, which can lead to worse accuracy than standard prompting. Another limitation is that CoT may not be equally effective for all tasks. It has been shown to be most effective for tasks involving arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning. For other types of tasks, the benefits of using CoT might be less pronounced or even counterproductive.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This lesson explored various techniques for creating more effective prompts for large language models. By understanding and applying these tips and tricks, you'll be better equipped to craft powerful prompts that enable LLMs to deliver accurate, contextually relevant, and insightful responses. Always remember that prompt engineering is an iterative process that may require refinement to obtain the best possible results.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, prompt engineering is a powerful technique that can help to optimize language models for various applications and research topics. By creating good prompts, we can guide the model to deliver accurate, contextually relevant, and insightful responses. Role prompting and chain prompting are two techniques that can be used to create good prompts, and we have provided practical examples of each. On the other hand, we have also demonstrated bad prompt examples that don't provide enough context or guidance for the model to generate a meaningful response. By following the tips and tricks presented in this post, you can develop a solid foundation in prompt engineering and use language models for various tasks more effectively.<br><br>\n",
