    "4. Assign necessary roles to the service account, such as \"Google Drive API - Drive File Access\" and \"Google Drive API - Drive Metadata Read/Write Access,\" depending on your needs.\n",
    "5. After creating the service account, access the \"Actions\" menu next to it, select \"Manage keys,\" click \"Add Key,\" and choose \"JSON\" as the key type. This generates a JSON key file and downloads it to your computer, which serves as your credentials_file.\n",

Each of these tools caters to specific file types and data sources, ensuring efficient and comprehensive data management.\n",
