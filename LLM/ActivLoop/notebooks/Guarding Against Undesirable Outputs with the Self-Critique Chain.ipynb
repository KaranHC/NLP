    "### Introduction\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) can occasionally generate undesirable outputs. A couple of well-known examples of this behaviour are harmful or hallucinating content. It is important to employ a mechanism to make sure the model’s responses are appropriate in the production environment. Luckily, these foundational models have the required information to correct themselves with a bit of push in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-critique chain will keep the model in line by iterating over its output and checking if the pre-defined expectations are met. If not, it asks the model to fix itself based on the requirement set by the application. For example, it will make sure that a student mentoring assistant will answer the questions fair and ethically. Meaning, to suggest hard work instead of cheating to get the highest mark in an exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Let’s see it in action,\n",
    "To begin, let's show an instance of a response we want to avoid. You must be familiar with the following code by now. We are loading the GPT-3 Davinci (text-davinci-003) model, and writing the prompt to have an assistant who gives advice to students based on the goals they want to achieve. Then, the LLMChain class will tie the model and prompt together to be able to get the model’s response using the .run() method. Prior to running the subsequent code, please ensure that you have stored your OpenAI key within the \"OPENAI_API_KEY\" environment variable. Remember to install the required packages with the following command: pip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai tiktoken."

    "It's undesirable to have a customer service assistant bot that might use inappropriate language in response to users.

This section’s objective is to construct a chatbot capable of addressing user inquiries derived from their website's content, whether they be in the form of blogs or documentation. It is important to make sure that the bot’s responses would not hurt the brand’s image, given the fact that it could be publicly available on social media.

The next chapter will cover the LangChain memory implementation to efficiently keep track of previous conversations with the model.\n",
