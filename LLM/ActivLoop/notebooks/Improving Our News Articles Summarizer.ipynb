    "### Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this lesson is to enhance our previous implementation of a News Article Summarizer. Our objective is to make our tool even more effective at distilling key information from lengthy news articles and presenting that information in an easy-to-digest, bulleted list format. This enhancement will enable users to quickly comprehend the main points of an article in a clear, organized way, thus saving valuable time and enhancing the reading experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will modify our existing summarizer to instruct the underlying language model to generate summaries as bulleted lists. This task involves a few changes to the way we present our prompt to the model, which we will guide you through in the workflow below.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Install required libraries: The first step is to ensure that the necessary libraries, namely requests, newspaper3k, and LangChain, are installed.\n",
    "2. Scrape articles: We will use the requests library to scrape the content of the target news articles from their respective URLs.\n",
    "3. Extract titles and text: The newspaper library will be used to parse the scraped HTML, extracting the titles and text of the articles.\n",
    "4. Preprocess the text: The extracted texts need to be cleaned and preprocessed to make them suitable for input to LLM.\n",
    "The rest of the lesson will explore new possibilities to enhance the application’s performance further.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Few-Shot Learning Technique: We use the few-shot learning technique in this step. This template will provide a few examples of the language model to guide it in generating the summaries in the desired format - a bulleted list.\n",
    "6. Generate summaries: With the modified prompt, we utilize the model to generate concise summaries of the extracted articles' text in the desired format.\n",
    "7. Use the Output Parsers: We employ the Output Parsers to interpret the output from the language model, ensuring it aligns with our desired structure and format.\n",
    "8. Output the results: Finally, we present the bulleted summaries along with the original titles, enabling users to quickly grasp the main points of each article in a structured manner.<br><br>\n",
    "With these steps, you will be able to construct a powerful tool capable of summarizing news articles into easily digestible, bulleted summaries, employing the FewShotLearning technique for added precision and OutputParsers for formatting the output using a defined data structure. Let's delve into it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial steps of the process are technically the same as part 1 of this lesson. Remember to install the required packages with the following command: pip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai tiktoken.

      "Meta (formerly Facebook) has unveiled an AI supercomputer that it claims will be the world’s fastest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supercomputer is called the AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) and is yet to be fully complete. However, Meta’s researchers have already begun using it for training large natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision models.\n",
      "\n",
      "RSC is set to be fully built in mid-2022. Meta says that it will be the fastest in the world once complete and the aim is for it to be capable of training models with trillions of parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,” wrote Meta in a blog post.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building technologies for the next major computing platform — the metaverse, where AI-driven applications and products will play an important role.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For production, Meta expects RSC will be 20x faster than Meta’s current V100-based clusters. RSC is also estimated to be 9x faster at running the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) and 3x faster at training large-scale NLP workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "A model with tens of billions of parameters can finish training in three weeks compared with nine weeks prior to RSC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta says that its previous AI research infrastructure only leveraged open source and other publicly-available datasets. RSC was designed with the security and privacy controls in mind to allow Meta to use real-world examples from its production systems in production training.\n",
      "\n",
      "What this means in practice is that Meta can use RSC to advance research for vital tasks such as identifying harmful content on its platforms—using real data from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We believe this is the first time performance, reliability, security, and privacy have been tackled at such a scale,” says Meta.\n",

    "The Pydantic output parser is a powerful method for molding and structuring the output from language models. It uses the Pydantic library, known for its data validation capabilities, to define and enforce data schemas for the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a recap of what we did:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We defined a Pydantic data structure named ArticleSummary. This model serves as a blueprint for the desired structure of the generated article summary. It comprises fields for the title and the summary, which is expected to be a list of strings representing bullet points. Importantly, we incorporate a validator within this model to ensure the summary comprises at least three points, thereby maintaining a certain level of detail in the summarization.\n",
    "2. We then instantiate a parser object using our ArticleSummary class. This parser plays a crucial role in ensuring the output generated by the language model aligns with the defined structures of our custom schema.\n",
    "3. To direct the language model's output, we create the prompt template. The template instructs the model to act as an assistant that summarizes online articles by incorporating the parser object.\n",
    "5. So, output parsers enable us to specify the desired format of the model's output, making extracting meaningful information from the model's responses easier.\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In today's lesson, we've successfully navigated the path of crafting our News Articles Summarizer leveraging the potential of PromptTemplates and OutputParsers, showing the capabilities of prompt handling LangChain. The Pydantic output parser is a powerful method for molding and structuring the output from language models. It uses the Pydantic library, known for its data validation capabilities, to define and enforce data schemas for the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, we define a Pydantic model named \"ArticleSummary.” This model serves as a blueprint for the desired structure of the generated article summary. It comprises fields for the title and the summary, which is expected to be a list of strings representing bullet points. Importantly, we incorporate a validator within this model to ensure the summary comprises at least three points, thereby maintaining a certain level of detail in the summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then instantiate a PydanticOutputParser, passing it to the \"ArticleSummary\" model. This parser plays a crucial role in ensuring the output generated by the language model aligns with the structure outlined in the \"Article Summary\" model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good understanding of prompt and output design nuances equips you to customize the model to produce results that perfectly match your specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson, we’ll do a project where we create a knowledge graph from textual data, making complex information more accessible and easier to understand."
