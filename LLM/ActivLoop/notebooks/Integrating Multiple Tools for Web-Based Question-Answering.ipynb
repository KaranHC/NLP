    "### Introduction\n",
    "As developers and information enthusiasts, we often find ourselves needing to utilize various tools and libraries to fetch and process data. By leveraging multiple tools simultaneously, we can create powerful, efficient, and comprehensive solutions for the systems we build with LangChain.  This lesson will demonstrate a practical example of combining the power of Google Search with the versatile Python-REPL tool for an effective result. You will learn how to harness the potential of multiple tools working together to streamline your own information retrieval projects.\n",
